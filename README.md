</p>

## About This Fork

This is an enhanced version of the [original Smart Collections Plugin](https://github.com/johnpc/jellyfin-plugin-smart-collections) by johnpc. The original plugin was designed to create collections based on Tags in your Jellyfin library.

### What the Original Plugin Did

The original plugin by johnpc allowed users to:
- Create collections based on Tags applied to movies and TV series
- Automatically update collections when items were tagged or untagged
- Configure custom collection names for each tag

### What This Enhanced Version Does

This fork extends the original functionality with:
- **Multiple Matching Methods**: Match content by Title, Studio, Genre, Actor, or Director
- **Media Type Filtering**: Filter collections to include only movies, only TV shows, or both
- **Advanced Expression Support**: Create complex collections using boolean expressions (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Filter by tags, parental ratings, community ratings, critics ratings, and production locations
- **Import/Export**: Easily backup and restore your collection configurations as JSON
- **Flexible Matching**: More options to create diverse and useful collections
- **Extensible Code**: Structured for easy addition of future matching types

## Examples of What You Can Do

With this enhanced version, you can:

1. **Title-based Collections**: Create collections of movies or TV shows containing a specific word or phrase in the title
   - Example: Match "Marvel" in titles to create a Marvel collection

2. **Studio-based Collections**: Group content from the same studio
   - Example: Match "Paramount" to collect all Paramount Pictures productions

3. **Genre-based Collections**: Organize content by genre
   - Example: Match "Thriller" to create a dedicated Thriller collection
   
4. **Media Type Filtering**: Separate movies from TV shows
   - Example: Match "Action" genre but only include movies, not TV shows

5. **Advanced Collections**: Create collections using boolean expressions
   - Example: `STUDIO "Marvel" AND (GENRE "Action" OR ACTOR "Robert Downey Jr.")`

6. **Tag-based Collections**: Group content with specific tags
   - Example: `TAG "Family-Friendly"` to create a collection of content tagged as family-friendly

7. **Rating-based Collections**: Create collections based on ratings
   - Example: `PARENTALRATING "PG-13"` for PG-13 content
   - Example: `COMMUNITYRATING ">8.5"` for highly-rated content (8.5+ stars)

8. **Critics Rating Collections**: Group by critics ratings
   - Example: `CRITICSRATING ">75"` for critically acclaimed content

9. **Geographic Collections**: Group by production location
   - Example: `PRODUCTIONLOCATION "France"` for French productions

The Auto Collections are kept up to date each time the task runs, automatically adding or removing items as they match or no longer match your criteria.
