## About This Fork

This is an enhanced version of the [original Smart Collections Plugin](https://github.com/johnpc/jellyfin-plugin-smart-collections) by johnpc. The original plugin was designed to create collections based on Tags in your Jellyfin library.

### What the Original Plugin Did

The original plugin by johnpc allowed users to:
- Create collections based on Tags applied to movies and TV series
- Automatically update collections when items were tagged or untagged
- Configure custom collection names for each tag

### What This Enhanced Version Does

This fork extends the original functionality with:
- **Two Collection Modes**:
  - **Simple Collections**: Quick setup with single-criterion filtering
  - **Advanced Collections**: Complex filtering with boolean logic expressions
- **Multiple Matching Methods**: Match content by Title, Studio, Genre, Actor, Director, Tags, and more
- **Media Type Filtering**: Filter collections to include only movies, only TV shows, or both
- **Advanced Expression Support**: Create complex collections using boolean expressions (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Enhanced Filtering Options**:
  - Filter by content metadata (title, genre, studio, actor, director, tags)
  - Filter by ratings (parental ratings, community ratings, critics ratings)
  - Filter by production locations/countries

- **Boolean Logic**: Combine multiple criteria with AND, OR, NOT operators and parentheses grouping
- **Import/Export**: Easily backup and restore your collection configurations as JSON
- **Case Sensitivity Control**: Choose whether matches should be case-sensitive or not
- **Scheduled Synchronization**: Collections automatically update on a schedule

## Examples of What You Can Do

With this enhanced version, you can:

1. **Title-based Collections**: Create collections of movies or TV shows containing a specific word or phrase in the title
   - Example: Match "Marvel" in titles to create a Marvel collection

2. **Studio-based Collections**: Group content from the same studio
   - Example: Match "Paramount" to collect all Paramount Pictures productions

3. **Genre-based Collections**: Organize content by genre
   - Example: Match "Thriller" to create a dedicated Thriller collection
   
4. **Media Type Filtering**: Separate movies from TV shows
   - Example: Match "Action" genre but only include movies, not TV shows

5. **Advanced Collections**: Create collections using boolean expressions
   - Example: `STUDIO "Marvel" AND (GENRE "Action" OR ACTOR "Robert Downey Jr.")`

6. **Tag-based Collections**: Group content with specific tags
   - Example: `TAG "Family-Friendly"` to create a collection of content tagged as family-friendly

7. **Rating-based Collections**: Create collections based on ratings
   - Example: `PARENTALRATING "PG-13"` for PG-13 content
   - Example: `COMMUNITYRATING ">8.5"` for highly-rated content (8.5+ stars)

8. **Critics Rating Collections**: Group by critics ratings
   - Example: `CRITICSRATING ">75"` for critically acclaimed content

9. **Geographic Collections**: Group by production location
   - Example: `PRODUCTIONLOCATION "France"` for French productions

The Auto Collections are kept up to date each time the task runs, automatically adding or removing items as they match or no longer match your criteria.

## User Guide

The Auto Collections plugin offers two modes for creating collections: **Simple Collections** and **Advanced Collections**.

### Simple Collections

Simple Collections provide an easy-to-use interface for creating basic collections with a single filter criterion.

1. To set it up, visit `Dashboard -> Plugins -> My Plugins -> Auto Collections`
2. For each simple auto collection you want to create:
   - **Match Type**: Select one of the following from the dropdown:
     - **Title**: Match by words or phrases in the title
     - **Studio**: Match by production studio
     - **Genre**: Match by genre
     - **Actor**: Match by actor name
     - **Director**: Match by director name
   - **Media Type**: Filter the collection content by:
     - **All**: Include both movies and TV shows (default)
     - **Movies**: Include only movies
     - **Shows**: Include only TV shows
   - **String to Match**: Enter the text to match against the selected match type
   - **Collection Name**: Provide a custom collection name (optional)
   - **Case Sensitive**: Choose whether the match should be case-sensitive (optional)
3. Click "Save"
4. Click "Sync Auto Collections" to update your collections immediately
5. Your Collections now exist!

**Simple Collection Limitations:**
- Each simple collection uses exactly one match criterion (Title, Studio, etc.)
- Cannot combine multiple criteria (e.g., can't match both a title AND a genre)
- Cannot use complex filtering beyond the basic media type filter

### Advanced Collections

Advanced Collections provide much more powerful filtering capabilities with boolean expressions.

1. In the Auto Collections settings, scroll to the "Advanced Collections" section
2. For each advanced collection:
   - **Collection Name**: Enter a name for your collection
   - **Expression**: Create a boolean expression using the following criteria types:

     **Content Metadata Filters:**
     - `TITLE "text"` - Match items with "text" in the title
     - `GENRE "name"` - Match items with "name" genre
     - `STUDIO "name"` - Match items from "name" studio
     - `ACTOR "name"` - Match items with "name" actor
     - `DIRECTOR "name"` - Match items with "name" director
     - `TAG "tag"` - Match items with "tag" in their tags
     - `PRODUCTIONLOCATION "location"` - Match items by production country/location

     **Rating Filters:**
     - `PARENTALRATING "rating"` - Match items with specific parental rating (e.g., "PG-13", "R")
     - `COMMUNITYRATING "value"` - Match items by community rating (supports comparison operators)
     - `CRITICSRATING "value"` - Match items by critics rating (supports comparison operators)

     **Media Type Filters:**
     - `MOVIE` - Match only movies
     - `SHOW` - Match only TV shows
     
     **Logic Operators:**
     - `AND` - Both conditions must be true
     - `OR` - Either condition can be true
     - `NOT` - Negate a condition
     - Use parentheses `()` for grouping expressions

   - **Case Sensitive**: Choose whether the matches should be case-sensitive (optional)
3. Click "Save" and then "Sync Auto Collections"

**Advanced Collection Benefits:**
- Combine multiple criteria (e.g., match a genre AND a specific actor)
- Create complex exclusion rules (e.g., match a genre BUT NOT a certain director)
- Use parentheses to group expressions for complex logic
- Apply multiple filters simultaneously
- Create highly specific, targeted collections

### Numeric Rating Syntax

For community and critics ratings in Advanced Collections, you can use comparison operators:
- `COMMUNITYRATING ">8"` - Greater than 8
- `COMMUNITYRATING ">=9.5"` - Greater than or equal to 9.5
- `COMMUNITYRATING "<6"` - Less than 6
- `COMMUNITYRATING "=7"` - Exactly 7
- `COMMUNITYRATING "7"` - Exactly 7 (equals sign is optional)

### Useful Advanced Expression Examples

- **Recent High-Quality Movies**: `MOVIE AND COMMUNITYRATING ">7.5" AND CRITICSRATING ">70"`
- **Family-Friendly Content**: `PARENTALRATING "G" OR PARENTALRATING "PG"`
- **Exclude Specific Content**: `GENRE "Horror" AND NOT DIRECTOR "Jordan Peele"`
- **Content from Specific Countries**: `PRODUCTIONLOCATION "Japan" AND GENRE "Animation"`
- **Actor in Multiple Genres**: `ACTOR "Tom Hanks" AND (GENRE "Drama" OR GENRE "Comedy")`
- **TV Shows with High Ratings**: `SHOW AND COMMUNITYRATING ">8" AND GENRE "Drama"`

### Import/Export Configuration

You can easily backup and share your collection configurations:

1. In the Auto Collections settings page, find the Import/Export section
2. Click "Export Filter Config (JSON)" to download your current configuration
3. Use "Import Filter Config (JSON)" to upload a configuration file
4. Click "Save" and then "Sync Auto Collections"

## Scheduled Synchronization

The Auto Collections Sync task is available in your Jellyfin Scheduled Tasks section and runs automatically every 24 hours. This ensures that your collections stay up-to-date as new content is added to your library or metadata changes.

You can also manually trigger a sync at any time:
1. From the Auto Collections plugin settings page by clicking "Sync Auto Collections"
2. From the Jellyfin Dashboard -> Scheduled Tasks section
